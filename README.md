  <h1>Mockoon's Playground</h1>
</div>

Mockoon's playground is a ready-to-use mock API for all your prototyping needs: fake JSON data, JSON placeholders, realistic CRUD API mock, etc. It is also a good way to discover Mockoon's features.

‚û°Ô∏è Playground API URL: [https://playground.mockoon.com](https://playground.mockoon.com)
‚û°Ô∏è [Playground's documentation](https://mockoon.com/playground/)

The playground offers the following resources, populated with fake data (generated using [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/)):

- [`/contacts`](https://playground.mockoon.com/contacts): a CRUD endpoint with fake contacts.
- [`/movies`](https://playground.mockoon.com/movies): a CRUD endpoint with fake movies.
- [`/photos`](https://playground.mockoon.com/photos): a CRUD endpoint with fake photos.
- [`/posts`](https://playground.mockoon.com/posts): a CRUD endpoint with fake posts.
- [`/todos`](https://playground.mockoon.com/todos): a CRUD endpoint with fake todos.
- [`/users`](https://playground.mockoon.com/users): a CRUD endpoint with fake users.

The following routes are available for each resource:

- `GET /resources`: Returns the entire array.
- `GET /resources/:id`: Returns an object by its id property.
- `POST /resources`: Inserts a new object in the array (autogenerate the id (UUID) if not provided).
- `PUT /resources/:id`: Performs a full object update by its id (replace).
- `PATCH /resources/:id`: Performs a partial object update by its id (merge).
- `DELETE /resources/:id`: Deletes an object by its id.

You can also use the sorting, searching and filtering query parameters on the main GET route, example: `?property_eq=test&page=2&limit=50`. You will find more information about the CRUD routes behavior in our [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/crud-routes/).

> üí° The following routes are disabled: `DELETE /resources`, `PATCH /resources`, `PUT /resources`. POST, DELETE, PATCH and PUT requests are persisted. GET requests are cached.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The playground is a shared resource (please don't abuse it) and is not meant to be used in production. Data are frequently reset.
