Mockoon's playground is a ready-to-use mock API for all your prototyping needs: fake JSON data, JSON placeholders, realistic CRUD API mock, etc. It is also a good way to discover Mockoon's features.

The playground offers the following routes, populated with fake data (generated using [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/)):

- `/posts`: a CRUD endpoint with 100 fake posts
- `/users`: a CRUD endpoint with 100 fake users
